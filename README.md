Personalized Learning. Real-Time Progress. AI-Driven Success.

🔍 Overview

The AI-Powered Personalized Tutoring System is a smart web platform that adapts to students' learning needs using Artificial Intelligence. It evaluates their knowledge, recommends a learning path, tracks progress, and enhances learning using a smart AI chatbot — Chintu, powered by Google Gemini API.

Built with 💙 by a passionate student team under the Intel® Unnati Industrial Training 2025 initiative.

🎯 Problem Statement

📌 "Build a personalized tutoring system that tailors learning content to students based on their initial knowledge, learning speed, and progress, using AI/ML techniques."

- 🌐 Lack of personalization in traditional learning.
- 🧠 One-size-fits-all content overwhelms slow learners or bores advanced ones.
